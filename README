#Moneropay simulator 

READ BEFORE USING 


This is a standalone flask application that simulates all of the
endpoints that Moneropay server offers. 

This is not a working system. This script is designed to help
developers writing integrations that make use of moneropay. The 
standalone script is helpful in debugging integrations since you don't have to worry about running a full monero node and database. 

The addresses are hardcoded. All interactions are dummy simulated data
